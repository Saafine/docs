# Combination
selection of items from a collection, such that (unlike permutations)
the order of selection does not matter. For example, given three fruits, say an apple,
an orange and a pear, there are three combinations of two that can be drawn 
from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear and an orange.

n   n!
  = -------
k   k!(n-k)!

# Permutation
the act of arranging the members of a set into a sequence or order, 
or, if the set is already ordered, rearranging (reordering) its elements—a process
called permuting. Permutations differ from combinations, which are selections of 
some members of a set regardless of order. For example, written as tuples, there 
are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1),
(3,1,2), and (3,2,1).

( Słowo podzbiór powinno, słusznie zresztą, sugerować, iż nie jest dla nas istotna kolejność elementów)
(Znów, tym razem słowo 'ciąg' ma nam podpowiadać, że tym razem interesuje nas kolejność.)
