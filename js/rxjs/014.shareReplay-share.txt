shareReplay()
- repeats ALL values to every subscriber
- stays hot even when refCount (all subscribers) is 0, so you can't cancel it with takeUntil()
- shareReplay(1) replays one last value

share()
- stays hot only when refCounts is bigger than 0
- flow example:
	- A subscribes
	- observable becomes hot
	- B subscribes
	- C subscribes
	- one request is made
	- A unsubscribes
	- B unsubscribes
	- C unsubscribes
	- D subscribes
	- observable becomes cold
	- second request is made
	- observable becomes hot
	- D unsubscribes
	- observable becomes cold
