// Partition
// Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x
// come before all nodes greater or equal to x.
// Important:
// The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right" partition; it does not need
// to appear between the left and right partitions.
// (The additional spacing in the example below indicates the partition.
// Yes, the output below is one of many valid outputs!
// Input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition = 5]
// Output 3 -> 1 -> 2      -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
