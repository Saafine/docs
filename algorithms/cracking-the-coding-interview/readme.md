# Questions to ask
- if the input is string:
  - ask about the encoding? Is it ASCII or Unicode?
  - does case sensitivity matter ?
  - is whitespace significant ?
- is the input sorted/unsorted?


# Strings
- string concatenation can be O(n^2) in a loop unless an array is used, then it's O(n)
