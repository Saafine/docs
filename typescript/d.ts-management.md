### Summary of `.d.ts` management
In general if you stick to the following steps you should have minimal `.d.ts` issues;
1. After installing any npm package as a dependency or dev dependency, immediately try to install the `.d.ts` file via `@types`.
2. If the library has a `.d.ts` file on DefinitelyTyped, the install will succeed and you are done.
If the install fails because the package doesn't exist, continue to step 3.
3. Make sure you project is [configured for supplying your own `d.ts` files](#setting-up-typescript-to-look-for-dts-files-in-another-folder)
4. Try to [generate a `.d.ts` file with dts-gen](#using-dts-gen). 
If it succeeds, you are done.
If not, continue to step 5.
5. Create a file called `<some-library>.d.ts` in your `types` folder.
6. Add the following code:
```ts
declare module "<some-library>";
```
7. At this point everything should compile with no errors and you can either improve the types in the `.d.ts` file by following this [guide on authoring `.d.ts` files](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html) or continue with no types.
