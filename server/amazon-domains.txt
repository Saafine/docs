# Adding domain & certficate to Cloudfront + Namescheap
- in namescheap specify:
	- alias record | @ | www.example.com
	- cname | www | xxx.cloudfront.net. (take from cloudfront)
	- URL Redirect record | * | https://www.example.com/
	- URL Redirect record | www | https://www.example.com/
- in cloudfront, add domain and certificate


# Make sure accessing URLs work:
https://xxx.com
http://www.xxx.com
www.xxx.com
xxx.com

# Adding Certificates
1. Go to AWS Certificate Manager
2. Request a public Certificate
3. Select 3 domain names: abc.com and www.abc.com and *.abc.com 
4. Select Email Validation

Other Validations:
- DNS validation
- Copy CNAME name and put it into domain provider
 - for example namescheap: manage domains / advanced dns / host records / add new record / cname
 - host: abc (NAMESCHEAP APPENDS domain name automatically so you don't copy the whole CNAME name from AWS dashboard)
 - value: CNAME value from AWS
 - Wait for Success status in AWS Certificates dashboard (did not work for certificate starting with www.)

# Checking cname (DNS Validation only)
- https://dev.to/namuny/integrating-aws-cloudfront-with-third-party-domain-provider-2ce3
