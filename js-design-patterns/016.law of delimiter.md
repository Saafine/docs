LoD tells us that it is a bad idea for single functions
to know the entire navigation structure of the system.

“Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units:
only units “closely” related to the current unit.
Each unit should only talk to its friends; don’t talk to strangers.”

You may call methods of objects that are:
1. Passed as arguments
2. Created locally
3. Instance variables
4. Globals

# Don't do:
obj.getX()
      .getY()
        .getZ()
          .doSomething();

Consider how much knowledge obj.getX().getY().getZ().doSomething() has.
It knows obj has an X, X has a Y, Y has a Z and that Z can do something.
That’s a huge amount of knowledge that this line has 
and it couples the function that contains it to too much of the whole system.
