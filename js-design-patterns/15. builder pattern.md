A builder pattern is in essence a wrapper object around all the possible parameters
 you might want to pass into a constructor invocation. This allows you to use setter methods to slowly
 build up your parameter list. One additional method on a builder class is a build() method, which
 simply passes the builder object into the desired constructor, and returns the result.

In static languages like Java, this becomes more important when you have more than a handful of
 (potentially optional) parameters, as it avoids the requirement to have telescopic constructors
 for all the possible combinations of parameters. Also a builder allows you to use setter methods
 to define read-only or private fields that cannot be directly modified after the constructor has been called.

// Builder
class FruitBuilder {
    String name, color, firmness;
    FruitBuilder setName(name)         { this.name     = name;     return this; }
    FruitBuilder setColor(color)       { this.color    = color;    return this; }
    FruitBuilder setFirmness(firmness) { this.firmness = firmness; return this; }
    Fruit build() {
        return new Fruit(this); // Pass in the builder
    }
}

// Usage
Fruit fruit = new FruitBuilder()
        .setName("apple")
        .setColor("red")
        .setFirmness("crunchy")
        .build();
