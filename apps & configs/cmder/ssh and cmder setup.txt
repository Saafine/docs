## SSH
ssh-keygen -t RSA -C "xxx@xxx.com"

open generated key and paste it into ssh keys on gitlab

make sure cmder setup is following:
:: use this file to run your own startup commands
:: use  in front of the command to prevent printing the command

:: call "%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%/cmd/start-ssh-agent.cmd"
:: set "PATH=%CMDER_ROOT%\vendor\whatever;%PATH%"

:: ssh-add "C:\Users\plabus\.ssh\id_rsa"

@echo off
ssh-agent | grep -v echo | sed -e "s/^/@set /" | sed -e "s/;.*$//" - > call.cmd
call call.cmd
del call.cmd
ssh-add "C:\Users\plabus\.ssh\id_rsa"

@cd /d "C:/dev/"
